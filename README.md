# TaskManagementAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Purpose

This project looks to make the organization of one's tasks for everyday projects an easy and managable process. This application will provide users the capability to make projects that contain many tasks. These tasks have helpful features like a timer or stopwatch so that you can optimize how you spend your time. Our focus with this application was to make it as fast, simple, and seemless as possible.

## Functionality 

Users can log in with their google account to sync to our firebase database. They will be able to save their specific projects and tasks to use on a later date.





## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
