# Lineup Task Management Application (Task Management Angular)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Purpose

This project looks to make the organization of one's everyday tasks in a comfortable and manageable manner. This application provides users with the ability to create multipurpose projects containing numerous tasks. Each created task can be customized to utilize various time management features, including a task timer, and a stopwatch. These features have been implemented to provide users with more options on how they wish to optimize their time. Our focus during the design and development of the Lineup Task Management Application was to develop a multifunctional task manager that is as simple and seamless as possible.
